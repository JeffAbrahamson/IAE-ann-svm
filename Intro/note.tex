The course title is a bit incorrect.  A better title would be ``Fun with Separators''.\\
``Avoir du plaisir avec des séparateurs''.

There will be weekly assignments.  We will discuss them in class but I
won't correct them unless you ask.

There will be a very short quiz at the beginning of each session.  It
will be easy if you did the assignment.  If you didn't, it will
probably be impossible.  (Sometimes it will be writing code.)

Olivier Darné has asked for the results.

There's a github repository.

Recommend use your own laptop if possible.  Python and other software
is free and easy to install.
