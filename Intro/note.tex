\notetitle{Introduction}

My name.  My email.

\begin{itemize}
\item Machine learning
\item Data science
\item Artificial intelligence
\item Big data
\end{itemize}

The course title is a bit incorrect : ``Big Data sous Python''.

A better title would be ``Fun with Separators''.\\
``Avoir du plaisir avec des séparateurs''.

There will be weekly assignments.  We will discuss them in class but I
won't correct them unless you ask.

There will be a very short quiz at the beginning of each session.  It
will start and end on time.  It will be easy if you did the
assignment.  If you didn't, it will probably be impossible.
(Sometimes it will be writing code.)

(Olivier Darné has asked for the results.)

There will also be a written examination the last day.  Your grade
will be a linear combination of your notes on the quizzes and the
final exam.

There's a github repository.

Recommend use your own laptop if possible.  Python and other software
is free and easy to install.  There's a help page in the git for
installing python.

You should create a github repository for the course.  \textit{Talk
  about how to ask questions.}  Code questions must be via github
issues.  (Tag me.)  Non-code questions may be by email or github as
seems most appropriate, but github issues are pretty convenient.
